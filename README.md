# TheBestWayToStore
Need to store something that you need super securly?
Well you found just the thing!

Lets say you need to store passwords.

With Equo you can simply save it by entering NameOfPassword = "password" | Make sure to use "" NOT ''
When you need to retrive it, just type the password name.
We reccomend settings it up like this so it is easy to remember: gmailSchool = "passwordeg1234"
